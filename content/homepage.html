<p>Hello, my name is Michał Siejak and I'm a professional software developer. This website serves as showcase of my selected works.</p>
<p>Solving interesting problems has been a hobby and a way of life of mine for many years now. I'm a strong believer in following the hacker way and a supporter of open source software movement. My main fields of interest include computer graphics, retro-computing, game development and general-purpose GPU computing. I'm also a co-founder of ALLien Senses demoscene group.</p>
<p>I provide software consulting services in a variety of areas. Visit <a href="https://www.lightflow.io">lightflow.io</a> for more information.</p>
