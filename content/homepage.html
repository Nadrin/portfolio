<p>
    Hello, my name is <strong>Michał Siejak</strong> and I'm a professional software developer specializing in
    computer graphics, game development, and general-purpose GPU computing.
	I currently work at <a href="https://marmoset.co/">Marmoset</a> on rendering in <a href="https://marmoset.co/toolbag">Toolbag</a>.   
</p>
<p>
	What I've been most passionate about throughout my career is supporting and empowering digital artists to create art and beauty.
    Outside of computing world I'm an avid science fiction &amp; tabletop RPG geek. I also sometimes spend my past-time doing
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game">live action role-playing</a> (though that's currently on hold due to pandemic).
</p>
<p>
    I'm a co-founder of <a href="https://www.codekinematics.com">Code Kinematics</a> which provides software consulting
    services in a variety of areas.
