    Solving interesting problems has been a hobby and a way of life of mine for many years now.
    I'm a strong believer in following <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">the hacker way</a>
    and a supporter of open source software movement.
    Outside of computing world I'm an avid science fiction &amp; RPG geek. I also sometimes spend my past-time doing
