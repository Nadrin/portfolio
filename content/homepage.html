    Hello, my name is <strong>Michał Siejak</strong> and I'm a professional software developer specializing in
    computer graphics, game development, and general-purpose GPU computing.
    This website serves as a <a href="<%= page_url("/portfolio.html") %>">showcase</a> of some of my works.
</p>
<p>
    Solving interesting problems has been a passion of mine for many years now.
    I'm a strong believer in following <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">the hacker way</a>
    and a supporter of the open source software movement.
    Outside of computing world I'm an avid science fiction &amp; RPG geek. I also sometimes spend my past-time doing
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game">live action role-playing</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a co-founder of <a href="https://www.codekinematics.com">Code Kinematics</a> which provides software consulting
    services in a variety of areas.
