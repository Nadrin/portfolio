    Hello, my name is Michał Siejak and I'm a professional software developer specializing in
    computer graphics, game development, and general-purpose GPU computing.

    Solving interesting problems has been a hobby and a way of life of mine for many years now.
    I'm a strong believer in following <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">the hacker way</a>
    and a supporter of open source software movement.
    Outside of computing world I'm an avid science fiction &amp; RPG geek. I also sometimes spend my past-time doing
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game">live action role-playing</a>.

    I'm a co-founder of <a href="https://www.codekinematics.com">Code Kinematics</a> which provides software consulting
    services in a variety of areas.
