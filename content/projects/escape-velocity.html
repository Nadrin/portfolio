summary:
    <p>
        My role in this project involved graphics programming and performance optimizations for the target device.
        Working with a relatively limited mobile GPU proved challenging and required a lot of creative thinking when
        authoring visual effects. Also, for the experience to be comfortable, the application had to render at smooth 60fps.

    In 2038 space missions are a routine thing. You are sent for standard maintenance mission to ISS â€“ now partially
    decommissioned, autonomous station. How hard can it be? Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned. You'll have
    to use the knowledge from your astronaut training that you hoped won't ever be needed and engage in spacewalk that
    you didn't anticipate.
