description: Physically based Vulkan RTX path tracer featuring a declarative scene description language based on ECMAScript 7.
summary: |
    <p>
        Quartz is an interactive unidirectional path tracing renderer built on top of <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt3d-index.html">Qt 3D near-realtime simulation framework</a> and is powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX">NVIDIA RTX technology</a> (via the Vulkan ray tracing extension).
        It supports rendering of complex 3D scenes and implements a physically based material model with metalness workflow.

<p>
    The rendering is progressive, meaning that the camera and all scene elements can be updated on the fly while the picture quality improves incrementally when there's no change. 
    Quartz implements a highly parallel architecture that fully utilizes the Qt 3D job system. All scene updates are handled by a collection of fine-grained jobs distributed among many worker threads.
</p>
<p>
    Several techniques for reducing variance have been implemented such as multiple importance sampling (MIS), next event estimation and Russian Roulette path termination.
</p>
<p>
    Features supported by the renderer include texture mapping (albedo, roughness &amp; metalness maps), geometry instancing, directional and area lights (via emissive geometry), IBL environment probes, and depth of field.
