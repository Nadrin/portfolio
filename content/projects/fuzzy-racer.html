        An AI racing robot written by me and my friend Miłosz Kosobucki as final assignment for <em>Fuzzy Set Theory</em> course
        at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland.

    It uses <a href="http://torcs.sourceforge.net/">The Open Racing Car Simulator</a> API to integrate into the game.
    The AI itself makes have use of a fuzzy logic controler to calculate acceleration, steering and geer shitfing behavior
    in respect to current track geometry, all in real-time. No opponent avoidance code is present at the moment but the robot
    performs reasonably well on various tracks alone.
