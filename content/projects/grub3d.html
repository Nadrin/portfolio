description: GRUB 3D is a proof-of-concept pseudo-3D maze crawler that can run as a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB2 bootloader</a> module.
summary: |
    <p>
        It uses legacy VESA 2.0 video mode to display graphics. Levels are rendered by casting rays through a 2D grid of blocks.
        Textures are drawn with nearest-neighbour filtering and affine projection.
        Experimental support for non-animated sprites is present in the code but not used in the demo level.

    It uses legacy VESA 2.0 video mode to display graphics. Levels are rendered by casting rays through a 2D grid of blocks.
    Each intersection point represents a single vertical line in the framebuffer - the further the point from the camera,
    the smaller each line gets thus an emulation of perspective projections is achieved. Textures are drawn with
    nearest-neighbour filtering and affine projection. Experimental support for non-animated sprites is present
    in the code but not used in the demo level.
</p>
<p>
    Levels are defined as C arrays directly in the source and textures/sprites are compiled into the module file.
    A simple map editor runs on Linux and can read/write internal map format or export to C header file.

    After booting the demo CD image type <em>grub3d</em> at the GRUB2 rescue prompt to play.
